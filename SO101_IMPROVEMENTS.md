## Quick Start

The easiest way to use the SO-101 arms is with the new teleoperation UI:

```bash
./start_lerobot_ui.sh
```

This will:
1. Automatically find and initialize conda
2. Activate the lerobot environment
3. Launch the interactive teleoperation UI

## Motor Safety System

### Overview
A comprehensive motor safety monitoring system has been added to protect the expensive servos from damage. Located in [`src/lerobot/motors/motor_safety.py`](src/lerobot/motors/motor_safety.py).

### Features
- **Temperature Monitoring**: Warns at 40¬∞C, critical at 45¬∞C, shutdown at 50¬∞C
- **Current-Based Stall Detection**: Detects motor stalls at 800mA sustained for 0.5s
- **Soft Start**: Gradual acceleration to prevent mechanical shock
- **Position Limiting**: Prevents motors from exceeding safe ranges
- **Emergency Stop**: Immediate shutdown capability

### Configuration
Safety monitoring is enabled by default with optimized 2Hz polling (reduced from 10Hz for performance):

```python
# In src/lerobot/robots/so101_follower/config_so101_follower.py
enable_safety_monitoring: bool = True
monitor_frequency: float = 2.0  # Hz - Optimized for smooth operation
temperature_shutdown: float = 50.0  # ¬∞C
current_stall_threshold: float = 800.0  # mA
```

### Usage
The safety system runs automatically in the background during teleoperation. To manually trigger emergency stop:

```python
robot.emergency_stop()  # Immediately disables all motors
```

## Collision Detection System

### Overview
Advanced collision detection with intelligent backoff and auto-recalibration. Full documentation: [`docs/collision_detection_system.md`](docs/collision_detection_system.md).

### Key Features
- **Intelligent Collision Detection**: Current (900mA) and torque (0.3) thresholds
- **Smart Backoff**: Backs away 0.1 units with 2-second cooldown
- **No Bouncing**: Prevents repeated hits on same obstacle
- **Auto-Recalibration**: Triggers after 5 collisions or 1 hour
- **Adaptive Performance**: Dynamically adjusts monitoring 0.5-10Hz

### Configuration
```python
# In config_so101_follower.py
enable_collision_detection: bool = True
collision_current_threshold: float = 900.0  # mA
collision_backoff_distance: float = 0.1
collision_max_retries: int = 3
auto_recalibrate_on_collisions: int = 5
```

### Testing
Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
python test_collision_detection.py
```

Test includes:
- Hand blocking detection (safe!)
- Wall collision with retry
- Adaptive performance monitoring
- Auto-recalibration triggers

## Teleoperation UI

### Features
The new interactive UI ([`lerobot_teleop_ui.py`](lerobot_teleop_ui.py)) provides:

1. **üöÄ Quick Start**: Auto-detect ports and run teleoperation
2. **üîß Calibrate Follower Arm**: Guided calibration process
3. **üéÆ Start Teleoperation**: Manual port selection and teleoperation
4. **üîç Identify Ports**: Auto-detect arms by voltage (Leader: 6-7V, Follower: 12V)
5. **üî¨ Motor Diagnostics**: Check motor health and status
6. **‚ùå Exit**: Clean shutdown

### Auto-Detection
The system now automatically identifies leader vs follower arms by voltage:
- **Leader arm**: 6-7.4V (typically blue arm)
- **Follower arm**: 12V (typically red arm)

## Motor Diagnostics

The new motor diagnostics feature (menu option 5) provides:
- Scan for connected motors on any port
- Display real-time voltage, temperature, and position
- Automatic arm type identification by voltage
- Health check for all connected servos

Example output:
```
Motor ID 1:
  Voltage: 12.1V
  Temperature: 32¬∞C
  Position: 2047
  
Average voltage: 12.0V
‚úÖ This is the FOLLOWER arm (12V)
```

This tool is invaluable for:
- Verifying motor connections
- Monitoring motor health during operation
- Identifying which arm is connected to which port
- Detecting any motor issues before they become problems

## Setup Scripts

### Complete Setup Script
[`setup_lerobot_complete.sh`](setup_lerobot_complete.sh) - One-command complete setup:
- Automatically fixes conda permissions on macOS
- Detects existing conda or installs fresh miniconda
- Creates and configures lerobot environment
- Installs all required dependencies
- Includes nuclear cleanup option for fresh starts

### Launcher Script
[`start_lerobot_ui.sh`](start_lerobot_ui.sh) - Smart launcher that eliminates all the conda activation headaches:
- Automatically finds conda installation (supports multiple locations)
- Properly initializes and activates the environment
- Launches the teleoperation UI with proper paths
- No more "conda: command not found" errors!

### Key Innovation
These scripts solve the common conda activation issues that plague many users, especially on macOS where conda often isn't in the PATH after installation.

## Troubleshooting

### Conda Permission Issues (macOS)
```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami):staff ~/.config/conda/
```

### Port in Use Errors
This happens when multiple processes try to access the same serial port. Solutions:
1. Ensure only one instance of the teleoperation is running
2. Check for stuck processes: `ps aux | grep lerobot`
3. Kill stuck processes: `pkill -f lerobot`

### Motor Not Found
1. Check USB connections
2. Verify power to the arms
3. Use Motor Diagnostics (option 5) to scan ports
4. Try unplugging and reconnecting USB cables

### Slow Operation with Safety Monitoring
The safety monitoring frequency has been optimized to 2Hz (from 10Hz) to minimize performance impact while maintaining protection.

## Key Improvements Summary
